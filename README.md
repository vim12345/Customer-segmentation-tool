In this project, we use K-Means clustering on synthetic customer data to identify distinct customer segments.

# ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates:
* Groups customers into segments using K-Means clustering

* Preprocesses data with standard scaling

* Visualizes high-dimensional clusters with PCA
